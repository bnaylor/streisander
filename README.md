# streisander
Dockerfile &amp; scripts for installing streisand (https://github.com/jlund/streisand) - the source for https://hub.docker.com/r/bnaylor/streisander/

It's just a little wrapper for the streisand installer so you don't need to install anything locally, or really breathe very hard at all.

./run.sh or docker run --rm -it -v <somedir>:/output bnaylor/streisander
